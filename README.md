# odin-landing-page

This project's purpose is to create an entire webpage from a design provided by the ODIN curriculum.

I made the website to kinda follow the provide design (though not exactly) but the whole thing breaks when zooming out or zooming in or resizing the windows.

I still need to fix the layout and have cleaner code but for now (at 100% display scaling and no browser zoom), the website looks fine.
